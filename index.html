                Leon Levy represents a house for sale at 250 josly School Road in East Berne,NY 12059.My wife and i were eager to buy the house,offered the buyer to sell us the house at that price,and were negotiating in good faith to settle on a closing date.
                Then Mister Levy informed us that there was another buyer.We were annoyed,but aslo understood that real estate is about money,among other things.We agreed to an escalation clause,won the right to buy the house in that way,and moved forward. 
                We finalized the settlement date,and had a fully signed and executed contract in hand.</span><span class="full-text"></span>This morning,Mr .Levy again stepped in to say that they were cancelling the contract through we have done nothing to abrogate the contract or to violate 
                its clauses in a way.Again, we are not naive,nor done fail to understand that Mr.Levy is incentivized to make his clients money.But he has,throughout this process,negotiated in bad faith, lied,and stymied our good-faith efforts to buy this
                house that we are so eager to have. He is the sort of real estate agent who gives a bad name to the profession. if you see a house that is represented by Mr.Levy,run away as quickly as you can.

                Mr.Leon Levy has consistenly demonstrated that he is the hardest working realtor. l have been involved in several 
                real estate transactions with Leon and he never disappoints. Leon has also handled transactions with my family and
                friends. Each has said that he makes them feel special and part of"his" family.</span><span class="full-text"> Taking care of his client's needs
                doesn't stop when he is on vacation (truly i didn't think he ever vacationed).
                Leon once called me on a weekend from 7000 miles away to give me an important update resulting in a sale.As with all
                his clients,Leon always makes you feel you're the only one he works for.It really does make a difference which realtor
                you hire.Leon will save you thousands. Can't praise him enough.

                My Fiancee and i are so happy we got to work with Leon to purchase our first home. His attention to detail and to his customer's 
                experience set him apart from other brokers's that we had worked with in the past. His desire to find us the perfect homes was
                evident in his adivce that we keep looking even when we felt that we were set on a house and told him so.
                His words and actions clearly demonstrated that he puts the intrests of his own.</span><span class="full-text">Another thing that set Leon apart was was his
                communication. Due to a problem on the seller's side,four months had elapsed between the signing of the contract and 
                the closing.During these months Leon was always available to carefully guide the process, working seamlessly with our attorneys,
                additional insepector and everyone else involved to get us seemd insurmountable.In the end, Leon did get us the perfect home.
                For the right price,against all odds. it was am extraordinary pleasure to work with him.We hope you get as well!</span>

               I cannot say enough about Leon. We found him through a longtime friend who had recently purchased her home.
               He was so patient in helping us to get our parent's house on the market(They lived there for almost 40 years 
               and it took 2 years to get them moved out). He had tremendous insighs and great recommendations. </span><span class="full-text"> 
               He is honest and quick to respond. when we were finally ready, the house sold in on time, thanks to his expertise.
               I cannot think of a better realtor and he sets the bar.You won't be disappointed! </span>
